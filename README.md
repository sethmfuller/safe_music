- Does not include common features such as
    - Ratings
    - Store
    - Related music
    - Related artists
    - Artist pictures
- Ties into Apple Music subscriptions allowing current subscribers to load all of their currently downloaded music. (Leave the door open for tying into other platforms such as Spotify and Youtube Music in the future)
- Provides the ability to be apart of an "group". The group can then share music playlists, songs, and albums, and everyone subscribed to that group would then have access. 
- Only music that you have a subscription for can you listen to. Music shared from an unsubscribed platform would be "greyed out." 
- For children, only music allowed by parents could be allowed. Maybe this could happen through a shared playlist or something. Or create an family group and different children have different privledges.
